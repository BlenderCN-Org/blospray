Bugs
- Camera clipping (start only) doesn't match cycles render, nor OpenGL preview

Fix/improve
- Correctly release the scene after rendering

Must haves
- Light UI panel
- Volume UI panel
- Camera UI panel
- More render settings in the UI
- TF editor in Blender
- Better error handling and recovery

Very nice to haves ;-)
- Interactive preview rendering
- UI buttons to preload/clear the scene on the server, including
  setting object bboxes of volumes to correct sizes

Nice to haves
- Start/stop server during rendering automatically
- Caching of large data sets across renders
- Border render
- UI button to get stats from server on currently loaded scene
- Log file for the server
- Reduce overhead in server -> client communication. E.g. render
  of angel.blend in 3840x2160 @ 4 spp takes 40.972s on the server,
  but 46.90s on the blender side (i.e. +14.5% longer)
- Textured geometry

Obscure to haves
- Handle multiple concurrent renders in Blender
- Optimize scene when Blender instances are used

Decide

Test


Look into
- How to leverage blender's node system
- OSPRay's extension modules and scenegraph, mostly w.r.t. model loading
