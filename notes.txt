- when using a custom render engine the following property editors are
  empty:
    - Render (incl. resolution)
    - Render Layers
    - Scene
    - World
  these all need to be provided by the render engine addon :/
  
  Even though things like scene.render.resolution_x|y are still available
  
  The Materials properties are empty, although cycles nodes are
  available in the node editor (provided bl_use_shading_nodes_custom = False)
  
  Light and Camera properties are also gone
