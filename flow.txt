Final render call flow
----------------------

user        presses F12
            
blender     creates new RenderEngine instance R

            calls R.update(data, scene)
            
addon       sends data to ospray, possibly some scene info as well
            
ospray      receives data

            sends back OK
            
blender     calls R.render(scene)

addon       sends render command to ospray

ospray      renders scene

            sends back framebuffer
            
addon       receives framebuffer

            sets render result
            
blender     shows framebuffer
            
blender     del R (XXX might actually show framebuffer after deleting R)
